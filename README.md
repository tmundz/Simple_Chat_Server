Simple_Chat_Server:

GOAL:
This program is supposed to allow multiple users to connect to the web server and message each other.

This will teach me how to set up a basic server and also to allow multiple connections and messages in the server.

TOOLS:
I am using async Rust and the Tokio crate.

STEP 1:
Create a basic echo server that allows users to connect and echo input.

STEP 2:
Allow users to communicate with each other. 


DISCLAIMER:
I am following a tutorial video on youtube to create this program.
